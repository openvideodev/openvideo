Tracks serve as an organizational layer in DesignCombo. They define the layering (z-index) of clips.

## Understanding Tracks

In DesignCombo, a "Track" is a logical container for clips. Clips in the same track are usually conceptually related (e.g., "B-Roll", "Voiceover", "Text").

- **Layering**: Tracks determine render order. By default, new tracks are added to the **top** (front-most) of the stack.
- **Organization**: Helps group clips.

## Creating Tracks

Tracks are managed by the `Studio`. You generally don't instantiate a `Track` class directly. Instead, you assign clips to tracks by ID, or let `Studio` create them automatically.

### addTrack()

You can explicitly add a track and optionally specify its index (position) in the timeline.

```ts
// Add a new track at the top (default)
const topTrack = studio.addTrack({ name: "Overlay Track", type: "Text" });

// Add a new track at a specific index
// Index 0 is the front-most layer
const trackAtBottom = studio.addTrack({ name: "Background", type: "Video" }, 10);
```

## Track Management

### moveTrack()

Move a track to a specific index. This automatically updates the visual layering (z-index) of all clips in that track.

```ts
await studio.moveTrack(trackId, 0); // Move track to front
```

### setTrackOrder()

Set the exact order of all tracks using an array of track IDs.

```ts
await studio.setTrackOrder(["track-top-id", "track-middle-id", "track-bottom-id"]);
```

### Implicit Creation

When you add a clip without a `trackId`, the Studio may create a new track for it or add it to an existing suitable track depending on logic.

```ts
// Add a clip to a specific track ID
await studio.addClip(clip, { trackId: "my-custom-track" });
// If "my-custom-track" doesn't exist, it will be created.
```

## Track Management

### Implicit Creation

When you add a clip without a `trackId`, the Studio may create a new track for it or add it to an existing suitable track depending on logic.

### Explicit Assignment

```ts
const textClip = new Text("Overlay", {});
await studio.addClip(textClip, { trackId: textTrackId });
```

### Removing Tracks

```ts
// Remove a track and all its clips
await studio.removeTrack(trackId);
```

## Layering Control

The layering of clips is directly tied to the track order. Tracks with a lower index are rendered on top of tracks with a higher index. Using the Reordering API ensures that your visual preview stays in sync with your timeline state.
